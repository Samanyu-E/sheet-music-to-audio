### Open Source Tools Used

This project leverages the power of open-source software:

- [Audiveris](https://github.com/Audiveris/audiveris)
- [Fluid (R3) SoundFont](https://member.keymusician.com/Member/FluidR3_GM/index.html)

These tools are included as external components and were not modified. Please refer to their respective licenses for full usage details.
Also FluidR3_GM.sf2 had to be deleted when uploading to github due to it large size. So to use this project you have to download [FluidR3_GM.sf2](https://keymusician01.s3.amazonaws.com/FluidR3_GM.zip) and place it under the soundfont folder.
